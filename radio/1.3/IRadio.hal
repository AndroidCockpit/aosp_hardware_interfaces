 * This interface is used by telephony and telecom to talk to cellular radio.
 * All the functions have minimum one parameter:
 * serial: which corresponds to serial no. of request. Serial numbers must only be memorized for the
 * duration of a method call. If clients provide colliding serials (including passing the same
 * serial to different methods), multiple responses (one for each method call) must still be served.
 * setResponseFunctions must work with @1.1::IRadioResponse and @1.1::IRadioIndication.

     * Setup a packet data connection. If DataCallResponse.status returns DataCallFailCause:NONE,
     * the data connection must be added to data calls and a unsolDataCallListChanged() must be
     * sent. The call remains until removed by subsequent unsolDataCallIstChanged(). It may be
     * lost due to many factors, including deactivateDataCall() being issued, the radio powered
     * off, reception lost or even transient factors like congestion. This data call list is
     * returned by getDataCallList() and dataCallListChanged().
     *
     * The Radio is expected to:
     *   - Create one data call context.
     *   - Create and configure a dedicated interface for the context.
     *   - The interface must be point to point.
     *   - The interface is configured with one or more addresses and is capable of sending and
     *     receiving packets. The prefix length of the addresses must be /32 for IPv4 and /128
     *     for IPv6.
     *   - Must not modify routing configuration related to this interface; routing management is
     *     exclusively within the purview of the Android OS.
     *   - Support simultaneous data call contexts up to DataRegStateResult.maxDataCalls specified
     *     in the response of getDataRegistrationState.
     *
     * @param serial Serial number of request.
     * @param accessNetwork The access network to setup the data call. If the data connection cannot
     *     be established on the specified access network, the setup request must be failed.
     * @param dataProfileInfo Data profile info.
     * @param modemCognitive Indicates that the requested profile has previously been provided via
     *     setDataProfile().
     * @param roamingAllowed Indicates whether or not data roaming is allowed by the user.
     * @param isRoaming Indicates whether or not the framework has requested this setupDataCall for
     *     a roaming network. The 'protocol' parameter in the old RIL API must be filled
     *     accordingly based on the roaming condition. Note this is for backward compatibility with
     *     the old radio modem. The modem must not use this param for any other reason.
     * @param reason The request reason. Must be DataRequestReason.NORMAL or
     *     DataRequestReason.HANDOVER.
     * @param addresses If the reason is DataRequestReason.HANDOVER, this indicates the list of link
     *     addresses of the existing data connection. The format is IP address with optional "/"
     *     prefix length (The format is defined in RFC-4291 section 2.3). For example, "192.0.1.3",
     *     "192.0.1.11/16", or "2001:db8::1/64". Typically one IPv4 or one IPv6 or one of each. If
     *     the prefix length is absent, then the addresses are assumed to be point to point with
     *     IPv4 with prefix length 32 or IPv6 with prefix length 128. This parameter must be ignored
     *     unless reason is DataRequestReason.HANDOVER.
     * @param dnses If the reason is DataRequestReason.HANDOVER, this indicates the list of DNS
     *     addresses of the existing data connection. The format is defined in RFC-4291 section
     *     2.2. For example, "192.0.1.3" or "2001:db8::1". This parameter must be ignored unless
     *     reason is DataRequestReason.HANDOVER.
     *
     * Response function is IRadioResponse.setupDataCallResponse()
     *
     * Note this API is same as 1.2 version except using the 1.3 AccessNetwork as the input param.
