/**
 * KeyCharacteristics defines the attributes of a key, including cryptographic parameters, and usage
 * restrictions.  It consits of two vectors of KeyParameters, one for "softwareEnforced" attributes
 * and one for "hardwareEnforced" attributes.
 *
 * KeyCharacteristics objects are returned by generateKey, importKey, importWrappedKey and
 * getKeyCharacteristics.  The IKeyMintDevice secure environment is responsible for allocating the
 * parameters, all of which are Tags with associated values, to the correct vector.  The
 * hardwareEnforced vector must contain only those attributes which are enforced by secure hardware.
 * All others should be in the softwareEnforced vector.  See the definitions of individual Tag enums
 * for specification of which must be hardware-enforced, which may be software-enforced and which
 * must never appear in KeyCharacteristics.
