     * finishRetrieval().This whole process is called a "credential presentation".
     *
     * It is permissible to perform multiple credential presentations using the same instance (e.g.
     * startRetrieval(), then multiple calls of startRetrieveEntryValue(), retrieveEntryValue(),
     * then finally finishRetrieval()) but if this is done, the sessionTranscript parameter

     *
     * Each of the provided accessControlProfiles is checked in this call. If they are not
     * all valid, the call fails with STATUS_INVALID_DATA.
     *
     * For the itemsRequest parameter, the content can be defined in the way appropriate for
     * the credential, but there are three requirements that must be met to work with this HAL:
     *
     *  1. The content must be a CBOR-encoded structure.
     *  2. The CBOR structure must be a map.
     *  3. The map must contain a tstr key "nameSpaces" whose value contains a map, as described in
     *     the example below.
     *
     * If these requirements are not met the startRetrieval() call fails with
     * STATUS_INVALID_ITEMS_REQUEST_MESSAGE.
     *
     * Here's an example of ItemsRequest CBOR which conforms to this requirement:
     *
     *   ItemsRequest = {
     *     ? "docType" : DocType,
     *       "nameSpaces" : NameSpaces,
     *     ? "requestInfo" : {* tstr => any}   ; Additional info the reader wants to provide
     *   }
     *
     *   DocType = tstr
     *
     *   NameSpaces = {
     *     + NameSpace => DataElements    ; Requested data elements for each NameSpace
     *   }
     *
     *   NameSpace = tstr
     *
     *   DataElements = {
     *     + DataElement => IntentToRetain
     *   }
     *
     *   DataElement = tstr
     *   IntentToRetain = bool
     *
     * For the readerSignature parameter, this can either be empty or if non-empty it
     * must be a COSE_Sign1 structure with an ECDSA signature over the content of the
     * CBOR conforming to the following CDDL:
     *
     *     ReaderAuthentication = [
     *       "ReaderAuthentication",
     *       SessionTranscript,
     *       ItemsRequestBytes
     *     ]
     *
     *     SessionTranscript = [
     *       DeviceEngagementBytes,
     *       EReaderKeyBytes
     *     ]
     *
     *     DeviceEngagementBytes = #6.24(bstr .cbor DeviceEngagement)
     *     EReaderKeyBytes = #6.24(bstr .cbor EReaderKey.Pub)
     *     ItemsRequestBytes = #6.24(bstr .cbor ItemsRequest)
     *
     * The public key corresponding to the key used to made signature, can be found in the
     * 'x5chain' unprotected header element of the COSE_Sign1 structure (as as described
     * in 'draft-ietf-cose-x509-04'). There will be at least one certificate in said element
     * and there may be more (and if so, each certificate must be signed by its successor).
     * This is checked and if the check fails the call fails with
     * STATUS_READER_SIGNATURE_CHECK_FAILED.
     *
     * The SessionTranscript CBOR is conveyed in the sessionTranscript parameter. It
     * is permissible for this to be empty in which case the readerSignature parameter
     * must also be empty. If this is not the case, the call fails with STATUS_FAILED.
     *
     * If the SessionTranscript CBOR is not empty, the X and Y coordinates of the public
     * part of the key-pair previously generated by createEphemeralKeyPair() must appear
     * somewhere in the bytes of DeviceEngagement structure. Both X and Y should be in
     * uncompressed form. If this is not satisfied, the call fails with
     * STATUS_EPHEMERAL_PUBLIC_KEY_NOT_FOUND.
     *
     * @param accessControlProfiles
     *   Access control profiles that are required to retrieve the entries that are going to be
     *   requested with IIdentityCredential.retrieveEntryValue(). See above.
     *
     * @param authToken
     *   The authentication token that proves the user was authenticated, as required
     *   by one or more of the provided accessControlProfiles. See above.
     *
     * @param itemsRequest
     *   If non-empty, contains request data that is signed by the reader. See above.
     *
     * @param signingKeyBlob is either empty or a signingKeyBlob (see generateSigningKeyPair(),
     *    below) containing the signing key to use to sign the data retrieved. If this
     *    is not in the right format the call fails with STATUS_INVALID_DATA.
     *
     * @param sessionTranscript
     *   Either empty or the CBOR of the SessionTranscript. See above.
     *
     * @param readerSignature
     *   readerSignature is either empty or contains a CBOR_Sign1 structure. See above.
     *
     * @param requestCounts
     *   requestCounts specifies the number of data items that are going to be requested, per
     *   namespace.  The number of elements in the vector must be the number of namespaces for which
     *   data items will be requested in retrieveEntryValue() calls, and the values of the elments
     *   must be the number of items from each namespace, in order, that will be requested in
     *   retrieveEntryValue() calls.
     *   Note that it's the caller's responsibility to ensure that the counts correspond to the
     *   retrieveEntryValue() calls that will be made, and that every retrieveEntryValue() call
     *   will succeed (i.e. that the access control profile checks will succeed).  This means that
     *   it's the responsibility of the caller to determine which access control checks will fail
     *   and remove the corresponding requests from the counts.
