     * be returned in `keyCharacteristics` are:
     *
     * - If the semantics of the tag are fully enforced by the IKeyMintDevice, without any
     *   assistance from components running at other security levels, it should be included in an
     *   entry with the SecurityLevel of the IKeyMintDevice.
     * - If the semantics of the tag are fully enforced, but with the assistance of components
     *   running at another SecurityLevel, it should be included in an entry with the minimum
     *   SecurityLevel of the involved components.  For example if a StrongBox IKeyMintDevice relies
     *   on a TEE to validate biometric authentication, biometric authentication tags go in an entry
     *   with SecurityLevel::TRUSTED_ENVIRONMENT.
     * - If the semantics are not enforced by KeyMint at all, SecurityLevel::KEYSTORE is used to
     *   indicate that Keystore should enforce.  Note that in Keymaster (predecessor to KeyMint),
     *   these tags would have been in SecurityLevel::SOFTWARE.
